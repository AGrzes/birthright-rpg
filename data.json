By far, this is the most organized and powerful church dedicated to the Silver Prince. As a theocracy, Medoere's official religion serves as the law of the land as well as the keeper of the faith. The primary cathedral is the grand Temple of the Celestial Spell, located in Alamier City. A second major cathedral, the Temple of the Ninth Spell, is in the capital city of Braeme. It's a smaller but no less beautiful version of the Alamier complex.\n\nThe Celestial Spell has other temples, churches, and shrines throughout the three provinces. The theocracy controls all nine levels of temple in the domain. Although other faiths are tolerated, none have been allowed to establish any kind of holdings in the domain. (One is trying, though.)\n\nThe Celestial Archpriest serves as the leader of the church, though individual temples have local leaders who answer to the regent. The church dominates the three provinces as far as the power of faith is concerned. Because the theocracy is also in charge of foreign affairs and keeping the domain intact, it hasn't made many inroads into other realms. Indeed, the church isn't that interested in crossing political borders. After all, Ruornil specifically directed his faithful to settle the lands that became Medoere, so that's the region the church concentrates its efforts on.\n\nThat doesn't mean the church's influence hasn't spread. Due to the good relationship Medoere has with Roesone, shrines dedicated to Ruornil have been established in a few of Roesone's larger cities and towns. In the province of Caercas, however, Ruornil's Celestial Spell commands about 25% of the population's faith (the church has a level 1 holding in Caercas). Most of this is concentrated in the Temple of the Silver Moon, located in the city of Proudglaive.","$path":["religion","church-of-the-celestial-spell","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:eastern-temple-of-nesirie","name":"The Eastern Temple of Nesirie","description":"The faith of Nesirie is popular among commoners, mariners, and the poor of Ilien. Things such as political intrigue and personal power are of no interest to the Temple of Nesirie, focusing more on actions than machination. This is significantly noted in the temple's holdings in the River Ward of the Free City. While walking through the ward, anyone not native to the city would most likely walk past the temple and not even know it. The leaders of the Nesiriean faith use their money for things other than elaborate cathedrals and elegant dress. Hence, their dwellings consist of renovated warehouses and century-old domiciles.\n\nA few years ago the Eastern Temple in Ilien fell upon some hard times. Many of the faithful of the Free City had gone to worship at the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn following their part in curing the plague in 546 MR. In the course of the next few months, the Eastern Temple was ready to pull out of Ilien and concede defeat to the Heart were it not for the zealous faith of Alliene Tilgentor. This young disciple refused to admit the citizens of Ilien cared nothing for the Goddess of the Sea, and began taking the teachings of Nesirie to the streets of the River Ward. Alliene's impassioned beliefs brought many of her fellow priests back from the brink of desperation, giving them the new hope and confidence the Eastern Temple needed to survive. The Eastern Temple of Nesirie is a level 3 temple holding under the control of the Council of Nesirie headed by Priestess Crennia Ylian (FA; Pr8; An, tainted, 11) and the Council of Seven including Alliene Tilgentor.\n\nThe Eastern Temple has strong ties to the trading community, and many merchants and mariners leave large offerings to Nesirie for her protection while traveling through the Straits of Aerele and the seas beyond. Even the guildlord el-Hadid contributes vast amounts of gold regularly to the Eastern Temple to insure the Lady of Mourning's protection. Though the faithful of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie are fewer than those of the Impregnable Heart, they have great influence in Ilien's large commerce network. Since the Heart concentrates its efforts with the nobility and rich in the castle ward, the Eastern Temple is the spiritual home of the poor and those finding themselves in hard times. New immigrants to the city have been increasing and the majority of them are counted among the poor.","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"temple","level":4,"originalLevel":3}],"$path":["religion","eastern-temple-of-nesirie","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:golden-plumes","name":"The Golden Plumes","description":"The Golden Plumes have been fiercely loyal to the regent of Ilien since their founding in 531 MR.

The present Count Bellam is their son, Sedrie. Sedrie is somewhat arrogant and resentful of his family's allegiance to a much younger and less well-established line such as the Roesones. Sedrie is an only child, and has no children of his own yet, but he has five first cousins and a number of second cousins.\n\nIt is said that Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, has been trying to convince the Bellamies to change allegiances to his domain, an act that would certainly provoke a major war.

The direct descendent of Roesone's oldest child is the baron by virtue of senior rank; all other members of the house are lords or ladies.\n\n**The Family Today**: The oldest Roesone living today is Darliene, the Black Baron's daughter who was married to the Bellamie family. She is a spry 78 years of age; she inherited some part of her father's indomitable will and carefully watches over her son Sedrie's management of the county of Bellamie.\n\nRaederic Roesone (MA; Fl; Br, major, 24), the brother of Teried, and his wife Marsiye are the uncle and aunt of Marlae. If something should happen to both the baron and the baron's brother Daenal, Raederic is third in line for the throne. Raederic lives comfortably on a spacious ranch in central Edlin; he appears to have no aspirations to the throne. His daughter is Shielin (FA; F3; Br, major, 24), cousin to the baron. She is a beautiful young woman with a crusader's fire, constantly involving herself in issue after issue.\n\nThe black sheep of the Roesone line is the bastard son of Raemel, the Black Baron's first son. His mother is not known, but it is suspected that she was a servant in Raemel's household. Arvuor (MA; Fl; Br, tainted, 12) is a seasoned adventurer who has had to fend for himself for many years; his father was murdered when he was only five years old, and no Roesone was anxious to look after Raemel's indiscretion. Arvuor currently holds the title of Lord of Cariemas, one of Raemel's old titles that he assumed without challenge.\n\nLast but not least, Marlae has a younger brother by the name of Daenal (MA; F/Tl; Br, major, 24) who is the heir apparent until the reigning baron produces a legitimate child. Daenal is an excitable fellow with a short attention span; he likes to travel and often disappears from sight for weeks at a time. His title, Lord of Highglen, is reserved for the heir apparent.\n\n**The Roesone Bloodline**: The Black Baron's descendants have inherited a major bloodline derived from the goddess Brenna. This probably predates Daen Roesone's birth, but it's also possible that he activated or enhanced the bloodline by forging his kingdom. Several members of the family have manifested abilities tied with Brenna's blood, such as the ability to speak with cats or see through their eyes.","$path":["house","house-roesone","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:ilien","name":"Ilien","fullName":"The Ilien County","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"law","level":7}],"$path":["domain","ilien","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:impregnable-heart-of-haelyn","name":"The Impregnable Heart of Haelyn","description":"# Ilien\n\nThe major faith center of the Ilienese is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, a level 4 temple holding under the control of the High Prefect Hubaere Armiedin. Worship of Haelyn has been present in Ilien since the battle at Mount Deismaar.\n\nWhen Ilien became a domain under the control of Lehoene Aglondier in 305 MR, a large group of Haelyn worshipers left the Dieman city of Aerele and came to the Free City. Lehoene greeted the Haelynites with open arms, gifting them with a portion of land in the then expanding Common Ward of the city. It was there the first Impregnable Heart of Haelyn temple was built.\n\nDespite financial assistance from the count, the Heart struggled for many years. In 546 MR, members of the Impregnable Heart singlehandedly cured a terrible plague that had begun to settle into the population of the Free City. In reward for their aid, Moeran Aglondier gave them a large section of the Castle Ward to build a new temple. The Heart built an awesome cathedral of higher learning and dedicated it to the faithful followers of Haelyn all across the land.\n\nThe faithful of the Impregnable Heart consist of scholars, tradesmen, farmers, soldiers and others wishing the blessing of the patron of Anuire. The Impregnable Heart itself commands a great deal of respect in many factions of Ilien's government, and- priests of the Heart often perform as arbitrators and statesmen in diplomatic matters. Decisions made as arbitrators can be as small as determining who pays for a newly paved street in the Market Ward to as large as negotiating treaty terms between warring lands. Favors of the Impregnable Heart may be asked for and granted, but usually demand generosity of some sort in return.\n\n# Roesone\n\nThe major faith of Roesone is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, one of the most powerful sects of Haelyn's faith. The temple predates Roesone's creation by many centuries; long before Daen Roesone built his barony here, the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn was a popular faith in Osoerde and Ilien. When Roesone was founded, the leaders of the temple immediately sent a party of priests and temple soldiers to build a temple to Haelyn's honor in Caercas, Roesone's capital. As the barony has grown, the temple has followed, and in the year 544 MR Teried Roesone declared the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn the official faith of the barony.\n\nThe major citadel and cathedral of the Impregnable Heart is located in Ilien, and the local temple leaders answer to the High Prefect Hubaere Armiendin (MA; Prll; An, major, 27). The High Prefect enjoys good relations with all monarchs whose subjects follow his faith, and rarely feels the need to flex the temple's muscle in internal affairs. He is extremely satisfied with the temple's expansion and growth in Roesone.\n\nOne of the Impregnable Heart's chief rivals is the Eastern Temple of Nesirie, headquartered in Aerenwe. High Prefect Hubaere of Haelyn's Temple feels that the Aerenweans should worship Haelyn too, since the people of Osoerde and Roesone (their immediate neighbors) follow Haelyn's faith. The High Prefect has even urged Roesone's lord to go to war with Aerenwefor religious reasons, but neither Roesone nor Aerenwe are that serious about their state faiths.\n\nThe High Prefect also greatly resents the temple of Ruornil in Caercas, a base from which Archpriest Suris Enlien of Medoere (FA; Pr4, Ruornil; Re, major, 32) hopes to spread her faith and influence. The High Prefect is wise not to challenge her directly, however, and has thus far not taken any overt action against the priestess or her temple.\n\nMost of Roesone's provinces are home to one or two regional temples, large chapels housing anywhere from a dozen to a hundred priests, acolytes, scholars, and guards. Up to a dozen isolated shrines and parish temples are scattered around each province, each served by only one or two priests. There are also several monasteries hidden in the most inaccessible reaches of Roesone, where the cloistered priests of Haelyn withdraw for silence and contemplation.","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"temple","level":3,"originalLevel":4}],"$path":["religion","impregnable-heart-of-haelyn","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:port-of-call-exchange","name":"The Port of Call Exchange","description":"Guild holdings are important to the economic survival of any domain in Cerilia, and Ilien is no exception.

El-Hadid does business with merchants and guildlords in several domains, bringing much-needed goods into the city, where he distributes the goods to retail merchant buyers through his guild holding, stores it for future use, or sells it to the Ilienese government.\n\nGoods sold to the state of Ilien are handled under Chancellor Moro Mentier, and usually consist of weapons, information and foodstuffs not normally available in Ilien. Chancellor Moro and el-Hadid do not particularly like each other, but they do have a good working relationship. El-Hadid knows better than to cheat or overcharge the chancellor, for Moro's scrutiny is very well kept. Moro has also learned not to pressure el- Hadid, or certain goods may become scarce or disappear altogether. It is a delicate relationship, with the well-being of the domain hanging in the balance. But even though some of el-Hadid's dealings are suspected of being felonious, much of what he does is well within the law.","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"guild","level":6,"originalLevel":7}],"$path":["guild","port-of-call-exchange","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:spider-river-traders","name":"The Spider River Traders","description":"The Spider River Traders began as a group of loggers and a sawmill who harvested the southern marches of the Spiderfell.

If there is profit to be made in Ilien (or any of the surrounding domains), el-Hadid will let nothing stand in the way of his share. He is a man of elegant dress, exquisite tastes, and unruly voraciousness. The guildlord can be polite and understanding one minute, a fierce cutthroat who would steal the purse off a dead man the next.\n\nIt is unknown where el-Hadid acquired the money to finance his immense trading enterprise. Rumors range from a wealthy inheritance to the theft of a deposed regent in far-off lands. In any case, el-Hadid appeared in the Free City of Ilien 12 years ago and immediately purchased a large section of the River Ward for his Port of Call Exchange. The Exchange is the largest trading company in southern Anuire, dealing in everything from fine silks to exotic wines to cattle and other live- stock. El-Hadid also has guild holdings in Roesone, Medoere and several other domains across Cerilia. It is also well known that el-Hadid is partial owner of the resort town of Aenier.\n\nEl-Hadid is by far the most powerful and most dangerous NPC in all of Ilien. Some ten years ago, one of el-Hadid's chief competitors was mysteriously murdered, and since that time the guildlord's activities have been under some scrutiny by the constabulary. No charges of misconduct have ever been brought against el-Hadid, but prudent char- acters should be very careful when dealing with him or his men.\n\nEl-Hadid employs nearly 400 traders, caravan masters and guards to protect his investments in Ilien. He has employees in additional domains, as well as other unknown contacts who serve in his network of spies and paid informants. He also has a secret arsenal of magical items (including his ring of human influence) which he uses to further his own greedy ends.\n\nOne thorn in el-Hadid's side is his inability to dominate Ilien's cattle trade. This is due in part mostly to the interference of the late Moeran Aglondier. Moeran discovered el-Hadid's practices early on, but by then the Khinasi trader already had his hooks so deep into the Free City's economy that bringing him down completely would have seriously disrupted trade in the domain. Instead, Moeran set about making sure he did not gain control of the cattle market, saving Ilien's farmers from being cheated out of their own profits. Moeran then went one step further to help ensure true free trade in the - city by appointing chancellors Kathaen Abeth and . Moro Mentier. Both are former traders whose businesses were destroyed through el-Hadid's shady tactics, and both keep a sharp eye on Hadid. Agents of the chancellors also operate trading companies supported by the regent to offer competition to the Port of Call Exchange, making sure farmers and cattle herders receive fair prices for cattle they bring to Ilien, Goewhyn, or Tennien.","$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:ilien","person:characters.yaml"],"$stem":"person:characters","$type":"person","parent":"domain:ilien"},{"_id":"person:elenir-goerin","$overlay":{"player":false},"name":"Elenir Goerin","title":["Grand Curate"],"$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:medoere","person:characters.yaml"],"$stem":"person:characters","$type":"person","parent":"domain:medoere"},{"_id":"person:erin","name":"Erin ...","label":"The Tax Comptroller","$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:roesone","province:abbatour","person:abbadiel.yaml"],"$stem":"person:abbadiel","$type":"person","parent":"province:abbatour"},{"_id":"person:erin-manero","name":"Erin Manero","label":"The Tax Comptroller","$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:roesone","province:abbatour","person:abbadiel.yaml"],"$stem":"person:abbadiel","$type":"person","parent":"province:abbatour"},{"_id":"person:francesco-labiano","name":"Francesco Labiano","label":"The Woodcutters Leader","description":"Big strong man in his forties, with huge muscles from decades of work, violent and pragmatic but protective and fair for his own people.

However, he did not descend from the ancient bloodlines. Rogr never felt so astonished as the morning he woke up to discover he had inherited the old man's bloodline, his royal name, and the Free County of Ilien. The count rules Ilien wisely and well, doing his best not to make the mistakes of the regents around him. Neither ambitious nor proud, he's willing to admit his faults. His people enthusiastically support him, for he keeps their loyalty high and their taxes low. Aglondier claims Ilien is neutral, a statement that strays a bit from the truth. He's good friends with the rulers from both Medoere and Roesone—without their tolerance, his domain wouldn't exist. Still, the nonpartisan illusion persists, so other rulers use the Free County of Ilien as a neutral meeting spot; regents have forged numerous treaties there.\n\n*   Lieutenants: Despite his many good qualities, Aglondier isn't really the trusting sort.

Rogr was a com- moner, fascinated by magic, when he met the Count and became his pupil. He studied magic, though as an unblooded human had no chance of rising far in the ranks of true magic spellcasting. Moeran took him as an apprentice, and having no other family, made plans to pass the regency on to Rogr. Now, with Moeran's untimely death, the fledgling Rogr is thrust into the regency of Ilien unexpectedly.\n\nRogr is an extremely intelligent individual, and the power he possesses coupled with the teachings of the old Count and his own growing skill makes him a formidable ruler. Rogr is the only known wizard in Ilien.\n\nRogr is a widower, his wife having died during the birth of his daughter Alliene. Alliene is a member of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie, and Rogr's only trusted lieutenant.\n\nThe suspected assassination of Moeran has unnerved the new regent of the land.

It was a good life; he profited from the trade and helped make others wealthy as well.\n\nOccasionally, he would supplement his cargo with passengers. One mysterious passenger, who paid his weight in gold, proved to be Garrilein's undoing. Though the passage across the Straits lasts only a day, this day would irrevocably change Garrilein's life.\n\nA storm boiled up, and the passenger's cloak was blown from his face. He was scaled and horned, a horrible lizard-like creature, and he began to slaughter the crew where they stood. Though Garrilein was only an average warrior, he couldn't stand idle while his crew was slaughtered. Summoning all his meager courage, he crept up behind the beast and drove a harpoon through its back. It expired on the harpoon, cursing him all the while.\n\nWhether it was the curse, or whether the slaying awoke Garrilein's latent blood, he gradually took on the beast's scales over the next few years. He soon could not show his face in public and was forced to deal through intermediaries and couriers. His appearance continued to worsen, until at last he slipped into the sea in an attempt to kill himself.\n\nHe found that immersion in water couldn't kill him; instead, the salt water of the Straits hastened his transformation and he eventually became a small sea serpent. The years have rendered him larger and more powerful; and although he is not actively evil, his transformation continues without cease.\n\nAlthough he now has little use for it, the Seadrake still collects treasure. Though he can no longer increase his fortune through honest work, he can now take it from the captains of the vessels that ply the Straits of Aerele. He has terrorized ships for the past 500 years, and after the first few decades, few dared deny him the treasure he seeks.\n\nHowever, the Seadrake does not take lives unless forced to do so in self-defense. He makes an exception for the pirate ships that attempt to steal what would be his. Apparently, he feels some obligation to earn the money he takes from the merchants; killing the pirates is his trade-off.\n\nThe Seadrake appears as a 50-foot-long serpent with a large, fan-like crest adorning his back. He is mottled green and blue, and he blends easily into the sometimes turbulent waters of the Straits. Fangs fill his mouth, and the flukes on his forequarters propel him powerfully through the water. He bears no trace of his former humanity except for his morals and his ability to understand all human speech.\n\nThe Seadrake can breathe both water and air without difficulty, but he has trouble moving on land. Although he has been known to pursue enemies onto dry land, he prefers the water, where he's more maneuverable and more dangerous.\n\n**Combat**: Ship captains give tribute to the Seadrake with little fuss for good reason. His bite causes 3dlO damage, enough to rend a normal man in a single pass of razor-sharp teeth. Alternatively, he can make a crushing attack with his two tremendous flukes, each causing 2d8 damage. Any breakable object must save vs. crushing blow when hit by his flippers or be shattered.\n\nThe Seadrake has recently discovered that his great size confers two additional forms of attack. He is now of a size such that he can swallow man-sized enemies; when he attacks with his bite, a roll of a natural 19 or 20 means that his victim has been swallowed whole. The victim suffers 1d20 damage passing over rows of teeth and into the Seadrake's gullet, then has Id6 rounds to cut himself free (by causing 20 points of damage to AC 5) before he drowns and burns to death in powerful stomach bile. Only weapons of size S can be used to cut him; there is no room to wield larger weapons.\n\nThe creature's other newly found attack is his crushing coil. He can wrap his length around any ship with a deck width of 20 feet or less and crush it. If the ship's wood fails a save vs. crushing blow, the hull splinters and the ship slowly sinks.\n\nThe Seadrake can spit an ink-cloud from under his flukes to assist his escape. The ink acts as a darkness spell with a 50- foot radius underwater; it is ineffective above water.\n\nThe Seadrake regenerates 2 hp per round while his wounds are underwater. If a wound is exposed to air for more than 3 rounds, it must heal normally. If reduced to -10 hit points, the Seadrake dies.\n\n**Habitat/Society**: The Seadrake has no society. He lives alone in a grotto under Baerghos Isle, gazing upon his treasure. A primitive tribe is said to live on the isle and worship the Seadrake as a god, but no one has set foot on the island in over two centuries to verify this.\n\n**Ecology**: The Seadrake patrols the Straits of Aerele, eating sharks and whales. If these are not available, he can survive on plankton or seaweed. He drags the tribute donated to him by sailors eager to avoid his wrath to his under- water grotto. A few reckless adventurers have pilfered from this grotto over the years, and many more plan carefully to enter when the Seadrake is away, but this is a foolish venture, for the Seadrake keeps no schedule, and can return at any instant. Despite his generally passive nature, he will kill anyone who tampers with his treasure. Although he has no use for the treasure, he enjoys its company and guards it jealously.\n\nA theory has been offered that the Seadrake collects treasure to remind him of his lost humanity. Some say he would do anything to regain that life, or to end this one. They're wrong in one respect - he fights viciously when attacked, as if he were afraid of death.\n\nTravelers on the Straits should be warned: Though the Seadrake can be bargained with, he demands tribute. He is nothing less than unreasonable if denied. No one has lived to tell a tale of escaping the Seadrake by promising to return with more gold. Though he is greedy, he is not stupid. No one escapes an encounter with the Seadrake with a full purse.","$path":["region:southern-coast","person:characters.yaml"],"$stem":"person:characters","$type":"person","parent":"region:southern-coast"},{"_id":"person:thuer","name":"Thuer","title":["Father"],"description":"*   A man of about 50 - high, thin, with tonsure and well combed long hair around it.\n*   A true belier and posing as blunt instrument of his God's will - underneath hides sharp intellect and pointy tongue\n*   Very experienced warrior without showing signs of his age\n*   Likes to wake up with the sun and proselytize until dusk.\n*   Thinks of Haelyn as a leader of the gods but see the place for the other gods underneath him.\n*   Thinks that if you don't follow Haelyns teaching you are simply hurting yourself\n*   Hates Ortodox Temple of Haelyn with deep fiery hate and talk about it worse than followers of Belnik and Kreiha\n*   Have a mace called Faith and a shield called Devotion with him - a  family heritage\n*   Is of noble origin but unbloodied and without inheritance - his family came from Mohrheid\n*   Had formal education in Imperial city of Anuerie\n\n## Relations\n\n*   Opposes The Mouse as the leader of largest whorehouse in Abbadiel and suspected cleric of some mischievous good\n*   Oposes The Woodcutters Leader against importing clerics of Ortodox Temple of Haelyn","$overlay":{"player":{"description":"*   A man of about 50 - high, thin, with tonsure and well combed long hair around it.\n*   Very experienced warrior without showing signs of his age\n*   Hates Ortodox Temple of Haelyn with deep fiery hate and talk about it worse than followers of Belnik and Kreiha\n"}},"$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:roesone","province:abbatour","person:original.yaml"],"$stem":"person:original","$type":"person","parent":"province:abbatour"},{"_id":"person:trevan-arele","name":"Trevan Arele","label":"The Port Master","description":"the person responsible for the port operation.

Both characters have to be present and willing (but may be coerced).\n\nIf target is unbloodied it gains source character's derivation, score and strength.\n\nIf target is bloodied it gains one half of the source's score.

He gets one point per level of target bloodline strength (but no more than target score). If killer is unbloodied he gains Tainted bloodline of victim's derivation.\n\nIf the kill is made with _tighmaevril_ weapon it grants one half of the target bloodline score and the kill does not have to pierce the heart.\n\nIf the victim have different bloodline derivation then the killer then the killer have to success on charisma medium (15) saving throw or gain victim's derivation. If the victim blood is stronger then the save is done at disadvantage, if weaker then at advantage. If the victim is of Azrai blood then the save is though (20).\n\n# Offspring\n\nWhen bloodied character breed the offspring can inherit the power. The child have stronger parent blood strength, average of both parents scores and stronger parent's derivation (in case of ties score decides, then fate). If one of parents is unbloodied then progeny have one half of bloodied parent score, one level lesser strength and the same derivation.\n\n# Improving Bloodline\n\nBloodied regent can draw power from the land to improve his bloodline score. The bloodline strength can be only archived by heroic (or in case of Azrai horrific) deeds.\n\n## Bloodmark\n\nBlooded character is marked as a scion by some visible body alteration, like birthmark, strangely colored strand of hair or something similar. Bloodmark become more pronounced as blood becomes stronger.

Character cannot have ability more potent than his bloodline strength. Character should not have more stronger abilities than weaker.
