By far, this is the most organized and powerful church dedicated to the Silver Prince. As a theocracy, Medoere's official religion serves as the law of the land as well as the keeper of the faith. The primary cathedral is the grand Temple of the Celestial Spell, located in Alamier City. A second major cathedral, the Temple of the Ninth Spell, is in the capital city of Braeme. It's a smaller but no less beautiful version of the Alamier complex.\n\nThe Celestial Spell has other temples, churches, and shrines throughout the three provinces. The theocracy controls all nine levels of temple in the domain. Although other faiths are tolerated, none have been allowed to establish any kind of holdings in the domain. (One is trying, though.)\n\nThe Celestial Archpriest serves as the leader of the church, though individual temples have local leaders who answer to the regent. The church dominates the three provinces as far as the power of faith is concerned. Because the theocracy is also in charge of foreign affairs and keeping the domain intact, it hasn't made many inroads into other realms. Indeed, the church isn't that interested in crossing political borders. After all, Ruornil specifically directed his faithful to settle the lands that became Medoere, so that's the region the church concentrates its efforts on.\n\nThat doesn't mean the church's influence hasn't spread. Due to the good relationship Medoere has with Roesone, shrines dedicated to Ruornil have been established in a few of Roesone's larger cities and towns. In the province of Caercas, however, Ruornil's Celestial Spell commands about 25% of the population's faith (the church has a level 1 holding in Caercas). Most of this is concentrated in the Temple of the Silver Moon, located in the city of Proudglaive.","$path":["religion","church-of-the-celestial-spell","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:eastern-temple-of-nesirie","name":"The Eastern Temple of Nesirie","description":"The faith of Nesirie is popular among commoners, mariners, and the poor of Ilien. Things such as political intrigue and personal power are of no interest to the Temple of Nesirie, focusing more on actions than machination. This is significantly noted in the temple's holdings in the River Ward of the Free City. While walking through the ward, anyone not native to the city would most likely walk past the temple and not even know it. The leaders of the Nesiriean faith use their money for things other than elaborate cathedrals and elegant dress. Hence, their dwellings consist of renovated warehouses and century-old domiciles.\n\nA few years ago the Eastern Temple in Ilien fell upon some hard times. Many of the faithful of the Free City had gone to worship at the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn following their part in curing the plague in 546 MR. In the course of the next few months, the Eastern Temple was ready to pull out of Ilien and concede defeat to the Heart were it not for the zealous faith of Alliene Tilgentor. This young disciple refused to admit the citizens of Ilien cared nothing for the Goddess of the Sea, and began taking the teachings of Nesirie to the streets of the River Ward. Alliene's impassioned beliefs brought many of her fellow priests back from the brink of desperation, giving them the new hope and confidence the Eastern Temple needed to survive. The Eastern Temple of Nesirie is a level 3 temple holding under the control of the Council of Nesirie headed by Priestess Crennia Ylian (FA; Pr8; An, tainted, 11) and the Council of Seven including Alliene Tilgentor.\n\nThe Eastern Temple has strong ties to the trading community, and many merchants and mariners leave large offerings to Nesirie for her protection while traveling through the Straits of Aerele and the seas beyond. Even the guildlord el-Hadid contributes vast amounts of gold regularly to the Eastern Temple to insure the Lady of Mourning's protection. Though the faithful of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie are fewer than those of the Impregnable Heart, they have great influence in Ilien's large commerce network. Since the Heart concentrates its efforts with the nobility and rich in the castle ward, the Eastern Temple is the spiritual home of the poor and those finding themselves in hard times. New immigrants to the city have been increasing and the majority of them are counted among the poor.","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"temple","level":4,"originalLevel":3}],"$path":["religion","eastern-temple-of-nesirie","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:golden-plumes","name":"The Golden Plumes","description":"The Golden Plumes have been fiercely loyal to the regent of Ilien since their founding in 531 MR.

The present Count Bellam is their son, Sedrie. Sedrie is somewhat arrogant and resentful of his family's allegiance to a much younger and less well-established line such as the Roesones. Sedrie is an only child, and has no children of his own yet, but he has five first cousins and a number of second cousins.\n\nIt is said that Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, has been trying to convince the Bellamies to change allegiances to his domain, an act that would certainly provoke a major war.

The direct descendent of Roesone's oldest child is the baron by virtue of senior rank; all other members of the house are lords or ladies.\n\n**The Family Today**: The oldest Roesone living today is Darliene, the Black Baron's daughter who was married to the Bellamie family. She is a spry 78 years of age; she inherited some part of her father's indomitable will and carefully watches over her son Sedrie's management of the county of Bellamie.\n\nRaederic Roesone (MA; Fl; Br, major, 24), the brother of Teried, and his wife Marsiye are the uncle and aunt of Marlae. If something should happen to both the baron and the baron's brother Daenal, Raederic is third in line for the throne. Raederic lives comfortably on a spacious ranch in central Edlin; he appears to have no aspirations to the throne. His daughter is Shielin (FA; F3; Br, major, 24), cousin to the baron. She is a beautiful young woman with a crusader's fire, constantly involving herself in issue after issue.\n\nThe black sheep of the Roesone line is the bastard son of Raemel, the Black Baron's first son. His mother is not known, but it is suspected that she was a servant in Raemel's household. Arvuor (MA; Fl; Br, tainted, 12) is a seasoned adventurer who has had to fend for himself for many years; his father was murdered when he was only five years old, and no Roesone was anxious to look after Raemel's indiscretion. Arvuor currently holds the title of Lord of Cariemas, one of Raemel's old titles that he assumed without challenge.\n\nLast but not least, Marlae has a younger brother by the name of Daenal (MA; F/Tl; Br, major, 24) who is the heir apparent until the reigning baron produces a legitimate child. Daenal is an excitable fellow with a short attention span; he likes to travel and often disappears from sight for weeks at a time. His title, Lord of Highglen, is reserved for the heir apparent.\n\n**The Roesone Bloodline**: The Black Baron's descendants have inherited a major bloodline derived from the goddess Brenna. This probably predates Daen Roesone's birth, but it's also possible that he activated or enhanced the bloodline by forging his kingdom. Several members of the family have manifested abilities tied with Brenna's blood, such as the ability to speak with cats or see through their eyes.","$path":["house","house-roesone","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:ilien","name":"Ilien","fullName":"The Ilien County","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"law","level":7}],"$path":["domain","ilien","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:impregnable-heart-of-haelyn","name":"The Impregnable Heart of Haelyn","description":"# Ilien\n\nThe major faith center of the Ilienese is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, a level 4 temple holding under the control of the High Prefect Hubaere Armiedin. Worship of Haelyn has been present in Ilien since the battle at Mount Deismaar.\n\nWhen Ilien became a domain under the control of Lehoene Aglondier in 305 MR, a large group of Haelyn worshipers left the Dieman city of Aerele and came to the Free City. Lehoene greeted the Haelynites with open arms, gifting them with a portion of land in the then expanding Common Ward of the city. It was there the first Impregnable Heart of Haelyn temple was built.\n\nDespite financial assistance from the count, the Heart struggled for many years. In 546 MR, members of the Impregnable Heart singlehandedly cured a terrible plague that had begun to settle into the population of the Free City. In reward for their aid, Moeran Aglondier gave them a large section of the Castle Ward to build a new temple. The Heart built an awesome cathedral of higher learning and dedicated it to the faithful followers of Haelyn all across the land.\n\nThe faithful of the Impregnable Heart consist of scholars, tradesmen, farmers, soldiers and others wishing the blessing of the patron of Anuire. The Impregnable Heart itself commands a great deal of respect in many factions of Ilien's government, and- priests of the Heart often perform as arbitrators and statesmen in diplomatic matters. Decisions made as arbitrators can be as small as determining who pays for a newly paved street in the Market Ward to as large as negotiating treaty terms between warring lands. Favors of the Impregnable Heart may be asked for and granted, but usually demand generosity of some sort in return.\n\n# Roesone\n\nThe major faith of Roesone is the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, one of the most powerful sects of Haelyn's faith. The temple predates Roesone's creation by many centuries; long before Daen Roesone built his barony here, the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn was a popular faith in Osoerde and Ilien. When Roesone was founded, the leaders of the temple immediately sent a party of priests and temple soldiers to build a temple to Haelyn's honor in Caercas, Roesone's capital. As the barony has grown, the temple has followed, and in the year 544 MR Teried Roesone declared the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn the official faith of the barony.\n\nThe major citadel and cathedral of the Impregnable Heart is located in Ilien, and the local temple leaders answer to the High Prefect Hubaere Armiendin (MA; Prll; An, major, 27). The High Prefect enjoys good relations with all monarchs whose subjects follow his faith, and rarely feels the need to flex the temple's muscle in internal affairs. He is extremely satisfied with the temple's expansion and growth in Roesone.\n\nOne of the Impregnable Heart's chief rivals is the Eastern Temple of Nesirie, headquartered in Aerenwe. High Prefect Hubaere of Haelyn's Temple feels that the Aerenweans should worship Haelyn too, since the people of Osoerde and Roesone (their immediate neighbors) follow Haelyn's faith. The High Prefect has even urged Roesone's lord to go to war with Aerenwefor religious reasons, but neither Roesone nor Aerenwe are that serious about their state faiths.\n\nThe High Prefect also greatly resents the temple of Ruornil in Caercas, a base from which Archpriest Suris Enlien of Medoere (FA; Pr4, Ruornil; Re, major, 32) hopes to spread her faith and influence. The High Prefect is wise not to challenge her directly, however, and has thus far not taken any overt action against the priestess or her temple.\n\nMost of Roesone's provinces are home to one or two regional temples, large chapels housing anywhere from a dozen to a hundred priests, acolytes, scholars, and guards. Up to a dozen isolated shrines and parish temples are scattered around each province, each served by only one or two priests. There are also several monasteries hidden in the most inaccessible reaches of Roesone, where the cloistered priests of Haelyn withdraw for silence and contemplation.","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"temple","level":3,"originalLevel":4}],"$path":["religion","impregnable-heart-of-haelyn","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:port-of-call-exchange","name":"The Port of Call Exchange","description":"Guild holdings are important to the economic survival of any domain in Cerilia, and Ilien is no exception.

El-Hadid does business with merchants and guildlords in several domains, bringing much-needed goods into the city, where he distributes the goods to retail merchant buyers through his guild holding, stores it for future use, or sells it to the Ilienese government.\n\nGoods sold to the state of Ilien are handled under Chancellor Moro Mentier, and usually consist of weapons, information and foodstuffs not normally available in Ilien. Chancellor Moro and el-Hadid do not particularly like each other, but they do have a good working relationship. El-Hadid knows better than to cheat or overcharge the chancellor, for Moro's scrutiny is very well kept. Moro has also learned not to pressure el- Hadid, or certain goods may become scarce or disappear altogether. It is a delicate relationship, with the well-being of the domain hanging in the balance. But even though some of el-Hadid's dealings are suspected of being felonious, much of what he does is well within the law.","holdings":[{"province":"province:ilien","type":"guild","level":6,"originalLevel":7}],"$path":["guild","port-of-call-exchange","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"organization"},{"_id":"organization:spider-river-traders","name":"The Spider River Traders","description":"The Spider River Traders began as a group of loggers and a sawmill who harvested the southern marches of the Spiderfell.

If there is profit to be made in Ilien (or any of the surrounding domains), el-Hadid will let nothing stand in the way of his share. He is a man of elegant dress, exquisite tastes, and unruly voraciousness. The guildlord can be polite and understanding one minute, a fierce cutthroat who would steal the purse off a dead man the next.\n\nIt is unknown where el-Hadid acquired the money to finance his immense trading enterprise. Rumors range from a wealthy inheritance to the theft of a deposed regent in far-off lands. In any case, el-Hadid appeared in the Free City of Ilien 12 years ago and immediately purchased a large section of the River Ward for his Port of Call Exchange. The Exchange is the largest trading company in southern Anuire, dealing in everything from fine silks to exotic wines to cattle and other live- stock. El-Hadid also has guild holdings in Roesone, Medoere and several other domains across Cerilia. It is also well known that el-Hadid is partial owner of the resort town of Aenier.\n\nEl-Hadid is by far the most powerful and most dangerous NPC in all of Ilien. Some ten years ago, one of el-Hadid's chief competitors was mysteriously murdered, and since that time the guildlord's activities have been under some scrutiny by the constabulary. No charges of misconduct have ever been brought against el-Hadid, but prudent char- acters should be very careful when dealing with him or his men.\n\nEl-Hadid employs nearly 400 traders, caravan masters and guards to protect his investments in Ilien. He has employees in additional domains, as well as other unknown contacts who serve in his network of spies and paid informants. He also has a secret arsenal of magical items (including his ring of human influence) which he uses to further his own greedy ends.\n\nOne thorn in el-Hadid's side is his inability to dominate Ilien's cattle trade. This is due in part mostly to the interference of the late Moeran Aglondier. Moeran discovered el-Hadid's practices early on, but by then the Khinasi trader already had his hooks so deep into the Free City's economy that bringing him down completely would have seriously disrupted trade in the domain. Instead, Moeran set about making sure he did not gain control of the cattle market, saving Ilien's farmers from being cheated out of their own profits. Moeran then went one step further to help ensure true free trade in the - city by appointing chancellors Kathaen Abeth and . Moro Mentier. Both are former traders whose businesses were destroyed through el-Hadid's shady tactics, and both keep a sharp eye on Hadid. Agents of the chancellors also operate trading companies supported by the regent to offer competition to the Port of Call Exchange, making sure farmers and cattle herders receive fair prices for cattle they bring to Ilien, Goewhyn, or Tennien.","$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:ilien","person:characters.yaml"],"$stem":"person:characters","$type":"person","parent":"domain:ilien"},{"_id":"person:elenir-goerin","$overlay":{"player":false},"name":"Elenir Goerin","title":["Grand Curate"],"$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:medoere","person:characters.yaml"],"$stem":"person:characters","$type":"person","parent":"domain:medoere"},{"_id":"person:erin","name":"Erin ...","label":"The Tax Comptroller","$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:roesone","province:abbatour","person:abbadiel.yaml"],"$stem":"person:abbadiel","$type":"person","parent":"province:abbatour"},{"_id":"person:erin-manero","name":"Erin Manero","label":"The Tax Comptroller","$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:roesone","province:abbatour","person:abbadiel.yaml"],"$stem":"person:abbadiel","$type":"person","parent":"province:abbatour"},{"_id":"person:francesco-labiano","name":"Francesco Labiano","label":"The Woodcutters Leader","description":"Big strong man in his forties, with huge muscles from decades of work, violent and pragmatic but protective and fair for his own people.

However, he did not descend from the ancient bloodlines. Rogr never felt so astonished as the morning he woke up to discover he had inherited the old man's bloodline, his royal name, and the Free County of Ilien. The count rules Ilien wisely and well, doing his best not to make the mistakes of the regents around him. Neither ambitious nor proud, he's willing to admit his faults. His people enthusiastically support him, for he keeps their loyalty high and their taxes low. Aglondier claims Ilien is neutral, a statement that strays a bit from the truth. He's good friends with the rulers from both Medoere and Roesone—without their tolerance, his domain wouldn't exist. Still, the nonpartisan illusion persists, so other rulers use the Free County of Ilien as a neutral meeting spot; regents have forged numerous treaties there.\n\n*   Lieutenants: Despite his many good qualities, Aglondier isn't really the trusting sort.

Rogr was a com- moner, fascinated by magic, when he met the Count and became his pupil. He studied magic, though as an unblooded human had no chance of rising far in the ranks of true magic spellcasting. Moeran took him as an apprentice, and having no other family, made plans to pass the regency on to Rogr. Now, with Moeran's untimely death, the fledgling Rogr is thrust into the regency of Ilien unexpectedly.\n\nRogr is an extremely intelligent individual, and the power he possesses coupled with the teachings of the old Count and his own growing skill makes him a formidable ruler. Rogr is the only known wizard in Ilien.\n\nRogr is a widower, his wife having died during the birth of his daughter Alliene. Alliene is a member of the Eastern Temple of Nesirie, and Rogr's only trusted lieutenant.\n\nThe suspected assassination of Moeran has unnerved the new regent of the land.

Therefore she takes care of most of her courtly work at night also, giving her capital city of Braeme a different schedule than the rest of the kingdom.\n\n*   **Lieutenants**: The high priestess has one lieutenant, the commander of Medoere's tiny army. Lord Kotrin Skirvin (MR; F3; An, minor, 18; CG) has a  little blood of his own, so the regent keeps a close eye on him, knowing that his ambition might strip away his common sense.

To stop the persecution of the followers of the Celestial Spell and save hundreds of innocents from slaughter, she was forced to kill her own father, Dalien, count of the eastern provinces. She was seen as the Moon God's Sacred Voice, and the people of the new realm adored her.\n\nIn the eight years since that fateful day, Medoere has flourished as a theocracy.\n\nOnly 24, Suris is a beautiful woman who is totally devoted to her faith and her god.

It was a good life; he profited from the trade and helped make others wealthy as well.\n\nOccasionally, he would supplement his cargo with passengers. One mysterious passenger, who paid his weight in gold, proved to be Garrilein's undoing. Though the passage across the Straits lasts only a day, this day would irrevocably change Garrilein's life.\n\nA storm boiled up, and the passenger's cloak was blown from his face. He was scaled and horned, a horrible lizard-like creature, and he began to slaughter the crew where they stood. Though Garrilein was only an average warrior, he couldn't stand idle while his crew was slaughtered. Summoning all his meager courage, he crept up behind the beast and drove a harpoon through its back. It expired on the harpoon, cursing him all the while.\n\nWhether it was the curse, or whether the slaying awoke Garrilein's latent blood, he gradually took on the beast's scales over the next few years. He soon could not show his face in public and was forced to deal through intermediaries and couriers. His appearance continued to worsen, until at last he slipped into the sea in an attempt to kill himself.\n\nHe found that immersion in water couldn't kill him; instead, the salt water of the Straits hastened his transformation and he eventually became a small sea serpent. The years have rendered him larger and more powerful; and although he is not actively evil, his transformation continues without cease.\n\nAlthough he now has little use for it, the Seadrake still collects treasure. Though he can no longer increase his fortune through honest work, he can now take it from the captains of the vessels that ply the Straits of Aerele. He has terrorized ships for the past 500 years, and after the first few decades, few dared deny him the treasure he seeks.\n\nHowever, the Seadrake does not take lives unless forced to do so in self-defense. He makes an exception for the pirate ships that attempt to steal what would be his. Apparently, he feels some obligation to earn the money he takes from the merchants; killing the pirates is his trade-off.\n\nThe Seadrake appears as a 50-foot-long serpent with a large, fan-like crest adorning his back. He is mottled green and blue, and he blends easily into the sometimes turbulent waters of the Straits. Fangs fill his mouth, and the flukes on his forequarters propel him powerfully through the water. He bears no trace of his former humanity except for his morals and his ability to understand all human speech.\n\nThe Seadrake can breathe both water and air without difficulty, but he has trouble moving on land. Although he has been known to pursue enemies onto dry land, he prefers the water, where he's more maneuverable and more dangerous.\n\n**Combat**: Ship captains give tribute to the Seadrake with little fuss for good reason. His bite causes 3dlO damage, enough to rend a normal man in a single pass of razor-sharp teeth. Alternatively, he can make a crushing attack with his two tremendous flukes, each causing 2d8 damage. Any breakable object must save vs. crushing blow when hit by his flippers or be shattered.\n\nThe Seadrake has recently discovered that his great size confers two additional forms of attack. He is now of a size such that he can swallow man-sized enemies; when he attacks with his bite, a roll of a natural 19 or 20 means that his victim has been swallowed whole. The victim suffers 1d20 damage passing over rows of teeth and into the Seadrake's gullet, then has Id6 rounds to cut himself free (by causing 20 points of damage to AC 5) before he drowns and burns to death in powerful stomach bile. Only weapons of size S can be used to cut him; there is no room to wield larger weapons.\n\nThe creature's other newly found attack is his crushing coil. He can wrap his length around any ship with a deck width of 20 feet or less and crush it. If the ship's wood fails a save vs. crushing blow, the hull splinters and the ship slowly sinks.\n\nThe Seadrake can spit an ink-cloud from under his flukes to assist his escape. The ink acts as a darkness spell with a 50- foot radius underwater; it is ineffective above water.\n\nThe Seadrake regenerates 2 hp per round while his wounds are underwater. If a wound is exposed to air for more than 3 rounds, it must heal normally. If reduced to -10 hit points, the Seadrake dies.\n\n**Habitat/Society**: The Seadrake has no society. He lives alone in a grotto under Baerghos Isle, gazing upon his treasure. A primitive tribe is said to live on the isle and worship the Seadrake as a god, but no one has set foot on the island in over two centuries to verify this.\n\n**Ecology**: The Seadrake patrols the Straits of Aerele, eating sharks and whales. If these are not available, he can survive on plankton or seaweed. He drags the tribute donated to him by sailors eager to avoid his wrath to his under- water grotto. A few reckless adventurers have pilfered from this grotto over the years, and many more plan carefully to enter when the Seadrake is away, but this is a foolish venture, for the Seadrake keeps no schedule, and can return at any instant. Despite his generally passive nature, he will kill anyone who tampers with his treasure. Although he has no use for the treasure, he enjoys its company and guards it jealously.\n\nA theory has been offered that the Seadrake collects treasure to remind him of his lost humanity. Some say he would do anything to regain that life, or to end this one. They're wrong in one respect - he fights viciously when attacked, as if he were afraid of death.\n\nTravelers on the Straits should be warned: Though the Seadrake can be bargained with, he demands tribute. He is nothing less than unreasonable if denied. No one has lived to tell a tale of escaping the Seadrake by promising to return with more gold. Though he is greedy, he is not stupid. No one escapes an encounter with the Seadrake with a full purse.","$path":["region:southern-coast","person:characters.yaml"],"$stem":"person:characters","$type":"person","parent":"region:southern-coast"},{"_id":"person:thuer","name":"Thuer","title":["Father"],"description":"*   A man of about 50 - high, thin, with tonsure and well combed long hair around it.\n*   A true belier and posing as blunt instrument of his God's will - underneath hides sharp intellect and pointy tongue\n*   Very experienced warrior without showing signs of his age\n*   Likes to wake up with the sun and proselytize until dusk.\n*   Thinks of Haelyn as a leader of the gods but see the place for the other gods underneath him.\n*   Thinks that if you don't follow Haelyns teaching you are simply hurting yourself\n*   Hates Ortodox Temple of Haelyn with deep fiery hate and talk about it worse than followers of Belnik and Kreiha\n*   Have a mace called Faith and a shield called Devotion with him - a  family heritage\n*   Is of noble origin but unbloodied and without inheritance - his family came from Mohrheid\n*   Had formal education in Imperial city of Anuerie\n\n## Relations\n\n*   Opposes The Mouse as the leader of largest whorehouse in Abbadiel and suspected cleric of some mischievous good\n*   Oposes The Woodcutters Leader against importing clerics of Ortodox Temple of Haelyn","$overlay":{"player":{"description":"*   A man of about 50 - high, thin, with tonsure and well combed long hair around it.\n*   Very experienced warrior without showing signs of his age\n*   Hates Ortodox Temple of Haelyn with deep fiery hate and talk about it worse than followers of Belnik and Kreiha\n"}},"$path":["region:southern-coast","domain:roesone","province:abbatour","person:original.yaml"],"$stem":"person:original","$type":"person","parent":"province:abbatour"},{"_id":"person:trevan-arele","name":"Trevan Arele","label":"The Port Master","description":"the person responsible for the port operation.

The person performing ritual decides about derivation.\n\nSource become unbloodied.\n\n# Bloodtheft\n\nWhen bloodied character is slain by piercing the heart the killer can get part of victim power. He gets one point per level of target bloodline strength (but no more than target score).

The child have stronger parent blood strength, average of both parents scores and stronger parent's derivation (in case of ties score decides, then fate). If one of parents is unbloodied then progeny have one half of bloodied parent score, one level lesser strength and the same derivation.\n\n# Improving Bloodline\n\nBloodied regent can draw power from the land to improve his bloodline score. The bloodline strength can be only archived by heroic (or in case of Azrai horrific) deeds.\n\n## Bloodmark\n\nBlooded character is marked as a scion by some visible body alteration, like birthmark, strangely colored strand of hair or something similar.

Character cannot have ability more potent than his bloodline strength. Character should not have more stronger abilities than weaker. There are no specific list of abilities only suggestions of the ability power level, abilities should be thematically linked to blood derivation.\n\n## Tainted\n\nTainted bloodlines does not grant blood abilities.\n\n## Minor\n\n*   Cantrip usable once between short rests\n*   Doubling proficiency bonus in specific circumstances\n*   Bonus proficiency\n*   Ability score improvement\n*   Slowed aging\n\n## Major\n\n*   1st level spell usable once between short rests\n*   Resistance for one damage type\n*   Advantage on selected attribute check in specific circumstances\n*   Special sense (darkvision, blindsense, ...) or improved existing one\n*   Communication and friendship with one selected kind of animal\n\n## Great\n\n*   2nd-3rd level spell usable once between short rests\n*   Advantage on selected attribute check in general circumstances\n*   Wild shape for one selected kind of animal\n*   Environmental adaptation (water breathing, immunity to nonmagical flame, feeding from sunlight,...)\n*   Small natural or magical armor bonus\n\n## True\n\nAnything that DM agrees on.\n","$path":["reference:bloodlines","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"reference"},{"_id":"reference:calendar","name":"Calendar","content":"A year has 388 days. The four annual days not part of any month have become times to celebrate and reflect. These days fall on the vernal equinox (the Day of Rebirth), the summer solstice (the Night of Fire, when a shower of falling stars results from annual passage through a meteor belt at the climax of Haelyn's Festival), the autumnal equinox (the Veneration of the Sleeping), and the winter solstice (the Eve of the Dead).\n\n# Months, days, and years\n\nThe 12 months of the Anuirean calendar begin with the Day of Rebirth, the vernal equinox. The month Sarimiere is the first of the new year, followed by Talienir, then Roelir. After Haelyn's Festival, the month of Haelynir begins. Anarire and Deismir (named for the Godswar's final battle) follow in succession, with the Veneration of the Sleeping next. Erntenir, the month of harvest, leads to Sehnir, then Emmanir, just before the Eve of the Dead. Then comes the coldest month, Keltier, which flows into Faniele, then Pasiphiel, and again, the Day of Rebirth.\n\nAnuireans devote six of the week's eight days to work, giving the remainder over to leisure. The days, from work's beginning to rest's end, are: Firlen, Relen, Dielen, Varilen, Branlen, Barlen, Mierlen, and Taelen.\n\nAlmost 2,000 years after the destruction of the old gods, Anuire's current yearly reckoning is 551 Michaeline (551MR), or 551 years after the death of Michael Roele, last Emperor of Anuire. In Khinasi lands, the year is 2039 MA (dating from the Masetian Arrival in Cerilia). In certain other parts of Cerilia, the year is 1524 HC (Haelyn's Count), recording the years since the battle of Mount Deismaar.\n## Month Names\n| Month | Name |\n| - | - |\n| | Day of Rebirth |\n| 1 | Sarimiere |\n| 2 | Talienir |\n| 3 | Roelir |\n| | Haelyn's Festival |\n| 4 | Haelynir |\n| 5 | Anarire |\n| 6 | Deismir |\n| | Veneration of the Sleeping |\n| 7 | Erntenir |\n| 8 | Sehnir |\n| 9 | Emmanir |\n| | Eve of the Dead |\n| 10 | Keltier |\n| 11 | Faniele |\n| 12 | Pasiphiel |\n## Calendar System Relations\n| Michaeline Reckoning (MR) | Haelyn's Count (HC) | Masetian Arrival (MA) |\n| - | - | - |\n| 0 | 973 | 1488 |\n| -973 | 0 | 515 |\n| -1488 | -515 | 0 |\n| 551MR | 1524 | 2039 |\n","$path":["reference:calendar","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"reference"},{"_id":"reference:character-options","name":"Character Options","content":"The following supplementary materials may be used after confirming with DM\n\n* [Artificer class](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/1_UA_Artificer_20170109.pdf)\n* [Barbarian options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_Barbarian.pdf)\n* [Bard options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_Bard.pdf)\n* [Cleric options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_Cleric.pdf)\n* [Druid options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_Druid11272016_CAWS.pdf)\n* [Fighter options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2016_Fighter_UA_1205_1.pdf)\n* [Fighter and Rogue options](http://dnd.wizards.com/sites/default/files/media/upload/articles/UA%20Gothic%20Characters.pdf)\n* [Monk options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/M_2016_UAMonk1_12_12WKWT.pdf)\n* [Paladin options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UAPaladin_SO_20161219_1.pdf)\n* [Ranger revision](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA_RevisedRanger.pdf)\n* [Ranger and Rogue options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2017_01_UA_RangerRogue_0117JCMM.pdf)\n* [Sorcerer options](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/26_UASorcererUA020617s.pdf)\n* [Warlock and Wizard options](http://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/UA%20Non-Divine%20Faithful%20SFG.pdf)\n* [Warlock and Wizard options](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/20170213_Wizrd_Wrlck_UAv2_i48nf.pdf)\n* [Feats](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/UA-Feats-V1.pdf)\n","$path":["reference:character-options","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"reference"},{"_id":"reference:languages","name":"Languages","content":"Replace language not on this list by any choice.

ot even most of of the Vos into Abbatuor - as there he could easily make them self sufficient by hunting. \nHe also suggested getting rid of the slaves as they were big drain on resources and only made Vos lazy.\n\nHormund agreed to relocate some of the Vos to Abbatuor, and decided to take the most likely dissidents. \nHe organized the move and traveled himself with the first bath.\n## Erbanien in Abbatuor\n`Ormus` and `Dunmro` returned by a portal deep in Erbanien and traveled towards Abbadiel.\n# 28.10.1524 HC\n## Erbanien in Abbatuor\n`Ormus` and `Dunmro` traveled towards Abbadiel.\n\n`Hormund` oversaw move of his tribe detachment to `Sven` camp.\n# 29.10.1524 HC\n## Evening -

just as if his massages to headquarters in Ilien would not teach their destination. \nLast but not least he shared information that **The Port** faces some troubles with local underground and despite heavy security is plagued by minor thefts from its warehouses. \n\nOrmus went to **The Fire** and demanded to talk with `Sami`. \nShe reminded him about a ash themed magic user prowling the city and evading invigilation.\nHe expressed outrage about attempts of extortion against **The Port of Call Exchange**. \nThey had heated discussion but reached preliminarny agreement when `Sami` stated thet her associated would be satisfied by a reasonable charitable donation instead of crude protection money. \nShe explained that supporting the poor is the biggest money drain on the underground, as other kinds of activities are usually self financing, and the underground takes their community commitments seriously. \n# 30.10.1524 HC\n## Abbadiel\n`Ormus` prepared and performed ritual filling `Hormund's` sword with magical power.\nHe succeeded but it took him most of thew day.\nAfter receiving his new enchanted sword `Hormund` went outside the city to practice with it.\n\nAfter the ritual `Ormus` discussed the current situation with `Malik` who conceded that after preliminary agreement with local underground thievery in **The Port** warehouses abruptly stopped, and in long term a donation will be less costly than round the clock heavy security.\nSuddenly they noticed impact on a window of the room they were in, they investigated the source and noticed street urchin who told them that the ash-magic user is robbing the warehouse with party artifacts in.\n\n`Ormus` took two guards and ran as fast as he could.\nWhen the guards opened a warehouse doors they all noticed some shadow-surrounded creature lifting the container with mebhaighl.\n`Ormus` trapped the thief inside a ball of force and sent a guard to find `Hormund`. \nThe thief summoned magical darkness to hide inside his prison.\nWhen the spell ran out the adversary teleported away from his initial location but was spotted by one of the guards and attacked by nails animated by `Ormus`.\nThe enemy teleported once again and was turned to dust by `Ormus` spell.\n\nUnfortunately all of his equipment and the mebhaighl container was destroyed at the same time so `Ormus` spent a lot of time putting the mystical energy back in some container.\n\n`Dunmro` spent the whole day serving the temple and a community that organized around it. \nHe scheduled a four weddings and a funeral for next few days, ha also chaired the parish council meeting.\nIn the evening `Father Thuer` notified `Dunmro` that his wife is in town so he vent to visit her.\n# 01.11.1524 HC\n`Hormund` and `Ormus` traveled to Ilien - to determine who is intercepting `Malik's` correspondence. \nThey shadowed the messanger to Aenier and then to Ilien.\n\n`Dunmro` spent the whole day in service with `Father Thruer` keeping his schedule extremely busy.\n\nAfter arriving in **Ilien** `Ormus` tried to break in into **The Port of Call Exchange** headquarters to set up alarm in the mail-room.\nHe broke in successfully but was almost captured when leaving.\nA magical trap stripped him of invisibility and raised alarm.\n\n`Ormus` went to visit `The Count od Ilien` and shared an update about situation in Abbadiel. \nIn turm `The Count` shared two important information.\nFirst that he reached an understanding with `El-Hadrid` - in exchange of `The Count's` support in fight with `Orthien Thane` the khinasi guilder agreed to loosen his grip on **Ilien** market and give some breathing room to local merchants.\nSecond that Ilien city reached its population limits within the walls and with slum outside walls it needed urgent expansion. It was decided to dig a channel around the city to create temporary defensive perimeter and to plan and build up infrastructure outside the walls.\n`Ormus` goa a **divining rod** from `The Count` to help him locate reservoirs of magic powering the spell affecting Abbatuor. \n# 02.11.1524 HC\n`Ormus` and `Hormund` got audience with `El Hadrid` who demanded explanation why `Malik` is sending him blank letters.\n`Ormus` tried to explain the spell affecting **Abbatuor** but failed to get the message across.\nNevertheless he persuaded `El Hadrid` to assign him a bunch of messengers with promise of reestablishing communication with **Abbadiel**.\n`Hormund` arranged new batch of supplies for his Vos.\n\n`Ormus` went back to `The Count` to copy some spell to his spell-book and then travelled to **Aenier** with `Hormund` and dozen of **The Port** messengers.\n\n`Dunmro` continued his service to the temple and community and noticed that the temple financial records were not maintained by `Father Thruer`. \n\n`Ormus` was experimenting with the messengers - trying to force them to break from the spell effect.\nHe managed to get breakthrough with two of them but not without manipulating their minds and seriously scarring their psyche.\nAt the end of the day he founded them an evening in **The Fire** paying with money received from `Malik`.\n\n`Hormund` was approached by `Sami` who told him that his Vos were causing trouble in **The Fire**, they were dealt with but she warned him that if he will not controll them better he will end as chief of _all woman tribe_.\n\n`Dunmro's` wife complained to him about some Vos causing troubler in the city.\n`Father Thruer` complained to `Dunmro` about `Sven` poaching some potential converts - in the ranks of the woodcutters - and turning them to his own **Erik's** faith.\n# 03.11.1524 HC\n`Ormus` continued the experiment with the messengers and managed to have next three to break from the spell effect.\n\n`Hormund` and `Dumnro` went to visit `Sven` independently.\n\n`Hormund` reached the camp first and demanded to know which Vos did made a trip to **Abbadiel**.\n`Sven` pointed hin to the culprits and promised to take them to accelerated survival course deep in the forest to made them forget the lure of a city.\n`Hormund` then visited the rascals, chided them and demanded to behave.\n\n`Dunmro` arrived second and demanded explanation why `Sven` is converting a **Haelyn** flock to his foreign religion.\n`Sven` explained that he see a need to create self sustaining community of people dedicated to protect the **Erbanien** and apparently **Haelyn** flock is not up to this task.\nThe discussion was heated with both sides unwilling to concede. \nEventually `Dunmro` realized that `Sven` is able to \"steal\" only small percentage of woodcutters so there is nothing to die for in this conflict and they parted ways.\n\n`Ormus` used his divining rod to locate two **mebhaighl batteries** in **Abbadiel**, one in the Haelyn Temple and another in the high captain castle.\nHe decided to start with the one in the castle.\nHe found a more precise location of his target behind a wall in the inner castle.\nHe went to `Malik` to organize working party and with multiple hours of hard work - breaking down the wall and removing rubble - managed to unearth the battery with some kind of mystical energy dispenser.\n\nWhen `Hormund` returned to the city he learned about the discovery from `Malik` and went to check it out.\nHe did not manage to learn anything but offered to guard the site from the squatters overflowing the castle.\n# 04.11.1524 HC\nIn the morning `Malik` sent some people to guard the battery and to put a doors in place of destroyed wall.\n\n`Ormus` investigated the temple and found out that his target is probably in the crypt.\nHe also found a inscription indicating that a person with foreign sounding name was entombed recently.\nIn the meantime `Dunmro` checked the book of funerals and found out that - first, `Father Thruer` maintained it and put a notes about the money received and spent on the occasion - second that some noble from Diemed was entombed in the temple crypt about one and a half year ago.\n\n`Ormus` went to **The Fire** and questioned `Sami` about the funeral and she was able to tell him that\n* No body was in the sarcophagus\n* The crypt was adjusted to accommodate the sarcophagus\n* **The Souther Anuerian Shipping and Imports** paid a lot of money to have the sarcophagus entombed\nJust after `Ormus` dunmro arrived and asked the same questions receiving the same answers.\n\n`Dunmro` questioned `Father Thruer` about the funeral and got information that something seriously fishy happened but the priest was not in charge then so he was not able to determine what exactly was wrong.\n\n`Ormus` enlisted `Hormund` for help and visited the temple during the midnight ritual.\nThey used invisibility spell to stay behind after the priests closed the doors.\nWhile `Hormund` started opening the crypt `Dunmro` returned and noticed traces of presence.\nHe used his divine power to detect magical auras and located the intruders.\n`Ormus` dismissed the invisibility spell and tried to bluff `Dunmro` into submission.\nHe failed, `Dunmro` took magical control of `Hormund` and used him to capture `Ormus` and take him outside.\n`Ormus` used spell to escape and a pursuit ensued intertwined with heated discussion.\nEventually `Hormund` persuaded `Dunmro` to check the crypt as he did not want to close it and open again next night.\n`Dunmro` reluctantly agreed but demanded `Ormus` to keep out.\nThey entered the crypt and found a suspicious sarcophagus without any markings.\nDunmro used a ritual to analyze magic around him and noticed a huge reservoir of magical energy inside sarcophagus.\nThey also noticed markings indicating that the location nad direction of sarcophagus was precisely determined.\n`Ormus` snuck in using another invisibility spell but was almost detected by `Dunmro` and forced to teleport outside to avoid facing the priest wrath.\n`Dunmro` noticed that three other sarcophagi were showing traces of magical aura.\nThey all left the temple closing the crypt behind.\n# 05.11.1524 HC\n`Dunmro` told `Father Thruer` about the mysterious magical energy in the crypt.\nFather asked him about someone well versed in arcane arts to examine it and determine if it is dangerous.\nNot trusting `Ormus` anymore `Dunmro` suggested `Master Yalisin` - his son's tutor from **Proudglaive**.\n\n`Father Thruer` assembled the council of local notables, merchants, artisans, representatives of guilds.\nHe explained that he attempted to bring some order and organize local community, but with various conflicting interests and without overriding authority it will not work in a long term.\nHe proposed to send `Dunmro` to `The Baroness` with mission of bringing back some deputy with authority to govern.\n`Ormus` and `Hormund` volunteered to accompany `Dunmro`.\n\n`Hormund` went to `Sven's` camp to bring a entourage of three Vos to underline his Chieftain status.\n\nMeanwhile `Dunmro` complained to `Father Thruer` and `Malik` about `Ormus's` last night behavior.\n# 06.11.1524 HC\nThe party spent a day travelling to **Talmore's Ferry**.\n\nAt the place `Ormus` used his divining rod to locate a magical cache inside **a john**.\nHe used a spell to remove the contents and unearthed a vessel of magical energy.\nAs they did not have idea what to do with it they covered it back with soil and went to sleep.\n# 07.11.1524 HC\nIn the middle of the day party reached a town and `Hormund` purcheased equipment for his retainers to improve their image.\n\nThe party reached a bridge on **The Black River** by the dusk.\nThey set up a camp near the bridge for the night.\n# 08.11.1524 HC\nIn the morning the party crossed the bridge.\nThey were screened by the

the city.\n\n`Donmro` went to search a particular amulet for a spell focus and eventually found it.\n\n`Ormus` visited the local branc of **The Port of Call Exchange** and inquired about local situation. \nHe learned that there is a heated competition with **The Spider River Traders**  but both sides keep things civilized. \nHe also got information about a plan to dig a canal through **The Passage** connecting **Adele River** and **The Spider River** and making it much easier for **Roesone** goods to reach **Ilien**. \n\n`Hormund` looked for information about planned events on the tourney field. \nHe learned that there is one tourney planned a month in the future.\n\n`Dunmro` went into **The Cathedral of Haelyn** and asked about whereabouts of the **Royal Chaplain**.\nHe got information that the priest is out of town at the court.\nHe also learned some local news, for example that **The Church of Ruornil's Celestial Spell** is just finishing a competing temple in the city.  \n\nThe party went to **The Blacktower Castle** to gain audience with `The Baroness`.\nThey approached outer guard tower, shown their letters of recommendation and waited for response.\nThey were let in and brought to another tower at outer castle where they were asked to leave all the heavy weapons and then brought to one more tower.\nThey were interrogated by a woman in her forties, with long black hair and willowy figure.\nShe introduced herself as `Tiesera of Shieldhaven` the herald of the barony.\nShe heard their story and offered them night in a castle tower and an introduction to the court tomorrow morning. \n\nThe party were brought to a residential tower and used rest of the evening to observe lifer in the castel.\nThey noticed a noble riding party entering the castle, and later the same nobles, in fresh clothes going to an evening feast.\n# 10.11.1524 HC\nThe Party was invited to a general audience. \nThey were placed in vestibule area with many nobles waiting for introduction.\n`Ormus` and `Dunmro` snuck out to improve their appearance with a little touch of magic.\nEvery person admitted to a great hall was introduced by a master of ceremony.\nThey saw\n* `Lady Sieresa Coriel`\n* `Brian Bjording` - son of `Sven Bjording countCount of Edlin`\n* `Helmut von Ritter` - cousin of The Chaplain \n* `Maria Bellamie` - daughter of `Sedrie Bellamie Count

Associate Prefect of Roesone, Thadeus von Ritter`\n\nAfter all the notables gathered in the great hall a string of petitioners were introduced each pleading own cause.\nThe general audience took more than two hours, and after that `The Baroness` inner circle moved to another chamber for private audiences.\n\nHalf an hour later the party was summoned to a private hearing. \n`Hormund` was asked to leave his retainers outside.\n\nThe party explained their mission with `Ormus` confusing everybody with his own unique way of speaking.\nThey got no immediate response but were promised that `The Baroness` will get back to them promptly.\n\n`Ormus` went back to the great hall to network with the nobles there.\nHe saw a scene where a strongly built woman approached a man, furiously broke engagement and challenged him to a duel by slapping him with plate gauntlet.\n`Ormus` saw his chance here **The Blacktower Castle** and approached the recovering man with intent of forging a connection.\nThe man was called `sir Roderic Bellamie` (a distant cousin of Count of Bellam`) a man with a name but not much else.\nThe woman was `Lady Guinevere` a knight with no heritage to speak of but wealthy by a means of being professional tournament player.\n`Ormus` and `sir Roderic` went to drink together and `Ormus` tried to gather as much information as possible.\n\n`Hormund` took hir retainers to the middle castle and started a combat practice using equipment there. \nHe was asked by one of the Vos to give them some money because they lost everything they had in a game of cards and they were just a few coins short from winning back with interest.\n\n`Dunmro` went back to **Proudglaive** to pass a message from his wife to local branch ot **The Spider River Traders**.\nHe learnt there is a heated competition with **The Port of Call Exchange** but both sides keep things civilized.  \nWhen leaving the city he ran into `Master Yalisin` who told him that it is good to see him because he have things to discuss about `Dunmro's` son, but he was summoned to the court and did not have time to talk.\nAs `Dunmro` also were going to **The Blacktower Castle** `Master Yalisin` offered to take him in his coach.\nOn the way the mage explained that `Dunmro's` son had undisputable magical potential and mastered basic magic without a trouble but the master was unable to teach him any real spells. \n`Master Yalisin` tried fev approaches but was loosing his hope nay one will work.\nHe told `Dunmro` it appears that in moments of stress the boy can perform magical effects, but was unwilling to push him without direct parental consent.\nHe also mentioned that there were some troubles with peers encountered at the court brewing, but nothing serious yet.\nThe mage left for his appointment when they reached the castle.\n\n`Hormund` was summoned by `The Castellan` who asked about what `Hormund` has to offer with his mercenaries.\nHe did not get any real offer but was promised a response in near future.\n\n`Dunmro` was summoned by `The Chaplain`. \nHe was admitted to a private office located above the castle chapel and guarded by `von Ritter` personal retainers.\nThe office was exquisitely furnished with huge, finely carved desk, pricy tapestries and rich library.\nThe host told `Dunmro` to explain his mission once again and then asked detailed questions.\n`Dunmro` sensed that `The Chaplain` is probing him, that he have his reservations about `Father Thruer` and that he have some personal stake in case.\n`Dunmro` tried to volunteer to manage situation in **Abbatuor** to the priest satisfaction but was turned down.\nInstead he learned that `The Prefect` is planning to appoint his cousin `Helmut` as provisional governor of `Abbatuor`.\nHe conceded that it will be temporary position as other noble houses would not allow to permanently strengthen his family but even for fev years it would give young man a great head start for a next position.\nHe implied that new governor would need somebody with a local knowledge to allow him settle in comfortably and that somebody could find his help very lucrative in the long term.\n\n`Ormus` located `Hormund` and told him that he arranged him a fight with third beast contender from the last grand tournament.\nWhat he did not told him was that contender was a woman and the man he would be standing in for behaved very untoward towards her.\n\n`Ormus`, `Hormund` and `Dunmro` went to a concert in the great hall.\nThe first performance was melancholic and touching song by `The Songstress Tiesera` sung in hair raising and stunning voice.\nNext there was a troupe playing dance numbers.\n\nIn the evening there was a feast with all the court present.\n`Hormund` learned about the circumstances of the challenge and that he will be standing against the wronged woman.\nHe was seriously unhappy with `Ormus` but let it slide for now.\n`Ormus` managed to place a bests for the party, for \"`Lady Guinevere` will loose\" with 4 to 1 odds.\nAll the characters bet on `Hormund`.\n# 11.11.1524 HC\nThe party did not attend morning audience but at the designated hour left for tournament field.\nThere

armor.\n`Hormund` entered the field and showcased his magical flaming sword.\nThe adversary seemed unfazed so `Hormund` thrown his cape to his retainers and combatants slowly approached each other.\nThey clashed and began hacking at each other with great force.\nThe exchange were fierce with both sides giving and receiving powerful blows.\nHalfway through `Ormus` used his magic to imbue `Hormund` with unnatural speed.\nEventually `Hormund` prevailed knocking  `Lady Guinevere` down and out, but he also was on the last legs.\n\nThe defeated received the first aid and was taken out of the field to be removed from remains of armor. \n`Ormus` retrieved the party winnings for yesterday waggers.\nBefore leaving the field `Lady Guinevere` approached `Hormund` and thanked for a good fight.\n\nWhen the party returned to the **The Blacktower Castle** they were summoned to another audience with `The Baroness` where they learned that.\n* `The Baroness` were sending `Tiesera of

back with them and support them \n* `Hormund` was asked to accept a mission for his mercenaries.\nThe goal of the mission would be to infiltrate the training grounds of the **Deiemed** mercenaries in

like it was reversed at the last moment.\n\n\nThe party sank to the level of the rays and followed one of them into corridor.\nThey noticed a skeleton of decomposed elf on the floor, behind that they found a room with four doors (including the one they used to enter) and a pedestal.\nThe pedestal had circular plate with moon rune on it and was a source of the magical energy following into the central chamber.\nOrmus tried to touch the plate but was shocked and forced to back off.\n\n\nThey opened the doors left of entrance and found a room with another five runic plates and another door.\nOrmus started performing ritual that would help him to understand the runes while Dunmro and Hormund tried to open the doors.\nThe task proven to be challenging and took many attempts.\nDunmro noticed that the doors are bungling and returning to their place after each attempt so he recognized that pressure is keeping them in place.\nIt was to late tough -

The Free Sailors Village on Isle of Tamale\nHormund started beheading bodies of the fallen sailors to gather skulls for his skull-throne.\nHe got a feeling of being engulfed in shadow and experienced a visions.\nIn first some wel armed Vos was negotiating with an finely dressed anuerian and assuring him that everything will be ass agreed - he only have to get back to bring rest of the tribe.\nIn second he saw Ludmila surrounded by lackeys and hanger-ons and drunk on what little power she got. \nAfterwards Hormund returned to the reality and to the beheading.\n\n\nDunmro examined the Bishop's hut.\nHe found a hidden hatch in the floor, bypassed a trap that protected it and entered a small shrine in the cellar.\nHe noticed a lot of holly symbols of various goods in there and sensed that shadows are extending from his boots and overwhelming him.\nThe wall of holly trinkets enlarge and went away with one symbol getting bigger thane every one else, a dagger with blackened blade.\nAfter a moment other symbols disappeared and a likeness of the isle of tamale appeared.\nThe dagger cut the isle in the middle and a fountain of treasures erupted.\nDunmro returned to the reality and decided to rest in the hut, refreshing his disguise as the bishop at the end.\n\n\nOrmus took one prisoner and ordered him to open a chest at the top of the tower.\nThe sailor objected but eventually complied, opened the chest and got blown dead by a trap.\nOrmus ordered another one to fetch the body and deliver it to Hormund.\nThe sailor objected but eventually complied.\nOrmus ordered next two sailors to bring the last remaining chest down.\nThey objected and all three tried to leg it but Ormus stopped them with a spell that bended their will.\nThe chest was tied to the rope and Ormus observed that merely moving the chest does not trigger the trap.\n\n\nAfter Hormund finished beheading he noticed that two sailors are trying to make a run. \nHe reached them and intimidated them into staying.\nThe sailors dug up fresh graves but found only decomposing bodies. \n\n\nOrmus ordered the chest to be placed in a shallow grave so he can trigger the trap from afar and the duck.\nHe was successful in his endeavour but got covered in dust, dirt and bodily remains after explosion. \n\n\nThe party filled the chests with heads and loot from the village and went back to the Vos fortress with the sailors carrying the chests.\n\n\n## Night - Isle of Tamale\nOn the way when there was no one looking Dunmro let two sailors - who were not carrying anything - escape.\nJust before the party reached the fortress they stopped and Ormus scouted the fortress using his familiar.\nHe noticed that about two dozen Vos passed out on the feast site and the other three dozen were gathered around Michail, he did not notice any guards on the walls or in the gates.\n\n\n## Night - The Vos Fortress on Isle of Tamale\nAs the party entered the fortress they were confronted by Michail ant the Vos.\nMichail disbelieved that Hormund is really Hormund and demanded for him to be subject to a test ordained by the Priest.\nHormund shown off his collection od enemy heads and went forward to slap Michail - who did not relent and ordered the Vos to size Hormund and to surround the rest.\nThere was an impas for fev moments while Michail explained that the test was to ve shaven with a silver knife.\nEventually Hormund conceded and they all moved to the shrine in the center of the arena where Hormund demanded to have the Priest to perform test.\nAs the priest was nowhere to be seen Dunmro went into hiding and disguised himself as the Vos priest - ordered Michail to shave Hormund's head and proclaimed that he is genuine Hormund.\nAfter that Dunmro as the Priest proclaimed that he will be leaving for a long time but Vos are to listen tu Dunmro as Dunmro in the meantime.\nDunmro changed back to himself and Hormund ordered to prepare skulls for his skull-throne.\nMichail told them that he need to get some slaves working on the throne itself and Dunmro volunteered to help. \nBefore departing Michail asked Hormund about the rest of the Vos in the Elven ruins - it transpired the the fake Priest told Vos that the real Hormund is imprisoned there.\nLudmila and Tatiana clashed and then each woman took their followers and went to the ruins to find Hormund taking about 80 Vos with them.\nHormund was only able to tell that they apparently missed him on the way. \n\n\nDunmro and Michail went to the slave quarters and Ormus decided to hang on.\nMichail rounded up some artisans and Dunmro laid out a blueprint for the throne.\nAfter Michail left two slaves approached Dunmro and asked him to meat in private.\nHe went deeper into slave quarters with Ormus and met with two slaves a mana and a woman who asked him as priest of Haelyn for help in freeing the slaves.\nThey discussed that at the moment the most of the Vos are dead drunk or out of the fortress so it may be a chance to overpower the rest and win the freedom.\nThey confessed that they have some weapons stashed and are ready to raise rebellion.\nDunmro urged them to wait and let him organize the escape. \nHe offered to perform a ritual to raise spirits and about twenty slaves participated in it.\n\n\nMeanwhile Hormund went to decide fate of the sailors.\nHe asked what he should do with them but got no sensible response.\nOne of the sailors offered a location of a treasure in exchange for his freedom.\nHormund promised that if the sailors wont deceive him he can get his freedom.\nThe sailor told Hormund about location of one captain's stash chained to lone rock north of the isle. \nHormund was disappointed that it was not an information about the gold stollen from the party but still offered the sailors to join the Vos instead of becoming slaves.\nThe sailors jumped aut the opportunity and Hormund arranged with Michail that they were to be inducted to the tribe.\n\n\nOrmus and Dunmro went to the caves to sleep.\nThey found that they stash was completely ruined with vases of magical energy broken and everything ransacked.\n\n\nJust before going to sleep ormus opened his mind to the cosmos to find out about location of the Bishop. \nHe got only unclear visions but then he heard a Voice.\nVoice questioned Ormus about limits in pursuit of knowledge, about man-made limits, society expectations, relations and allies, about divine imposed limits and last about self imposed limits.\n\n\nDuring the night Dunmro got a vision of blackened dagger probing around the isle of Tamale while entire island was surrounded by a snare.\n\n\nDuring the night Ormus had a visions of Various khinasi mages dabbling in the dark arts and getting incapacitated by the curse.\nOne of them tried to animate body of ancient sage to learn his secrets and was stripped of magic and killed by the undead.\nAnother one tried to counter the curse only to be stuck by another and living his life as wretched homeless disfigured creature. \nEventually ormus learned that the curse have 7 distinct forms and that here ia a spell to break each of them but one can not cast any spell after being stuck by the curses. \n\n\n## Morning - Elven ruins of the coast of Isle of Tamale\nHormund went alone to the ruins looking for Ludmila and his Vos.\nHe located entrance used by Ludmila's group and wnet into the dungeon.\nHe encountered a body of a Vos with back and spinal cord sliced.\nAfter that he found a chamber where Vos were fighting wights leaving 5 Vos and two wights on the battlefield.\nHe immolated the wight bodies to prevent them from raising again and pressed further.\n\n\nIn the next chamber he heard something, called for Ludmila and found a single aged Vos hiding in an alcove.\nTHe survivor was from the Tatiana group, and told Hormund their story.\nThey entered the ruins, fought some wights and took light casualties.\nAfter that they encountered a big chamber where they were surprised by immaterial spectres.\nThe sole vos did leg it and hid the whole time afterwards.\nHormund gave vos a choice - to go back on his own, stay hidden or accompany him - tha survivor decided to go with his chief.\nThey encountered a camber with four wights laying in ambush which were dispatched by Hormund.\n\n\nPressing on Hormund encountered split path with tracks of Vos on the both sides. He decided to follow the one with the smell of Ludmila.\nThey encountered another battlefield with a fev Vos bodies and two tracks leading two ways.\nThe lone Vos noticed that the dead are from both groups.\nHormund decided to check the left track first and they reached a chamber where ghosts attacked Tatiana's group.\nThey backtracked and checked the other track.\n\n\nThey encountered another chamber - with a tree in it and a dozen or so Vos bodies with no visible wounds apart of some ear-bled.\nConfronted again with split track Hormund followed the one with Ludmila scent but then he heard sound of combat behind his back.\nHe went back and found the remnants of Tatiana's group fighting with wights. \n\n\nHormund charged four undead archers on a bridge over a chasm and pushed all of them over into the abyss.\nIn the meantime Tatiana and her people fought valiantly against undead onslaught and managed to get some undead down but were also taking heavy looses.\nHormund charged again and managed to kill most ow wights when incorporeal spectre appeared.\nHormund charged against new threat but it ignored him, and emptied horrible wail that incapacitated all but one Vos.\nHormund destroyed the banshee and dispatched two remaining wights. \n\n\nIt turned out that 6 Vos survived their wounds - including Tatiana.\n\n\n","$path":["48","metadata.yaml"],"$stem":"metadata","$type":"session","lp":48},{"_id":"session:49","date":"27-29.09.2019","name":"Session 49","awards":{"$overlay":{"player":{"xpExplanation":false}},"xp":13400,"xpExplanation":"600 -

supporting the accusation with testimony from multiple witness, interrogation of several dead and one living Vos and sworn statements from baron's mages who watched the events using divinations.\nThere were some exaggerations but whole document was close enough to truth to make it hard to dismiss.\nIn addition there were details between the lines that could only come from somebody who watched the party for quite some time.\n\n\nThe Count told ormus that he is forced to disavow him and while he is not under arrest yet it would be better for everyone if he could keep away from Ilien for next couple of decades.\nOrmus was visibly unhappy with the development and asked count for a chance to copy some spells -

and decided that they need to immiedetley go to Diemed and cut the accusations at the root.\nMalik told Ormus that he will write a letter to El-Hadrid and then they will take the port's ship and sail straight to the city of Arele.\nOrmus agreed but suggested that they should take Dunmro and HOrmund with them.\nMalik told him that the ship will need fev hours for unloading so he can go look for his companions.\n\n\nDunmro went to meet with Malik and got abridged version of situation.\nHe declared that he will go but have to talk with Father Thuer first.\nHe met with Ormus and they both left the depot.\n\n\n## Morning -
